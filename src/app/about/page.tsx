        </a>
        ’s Document Assembly Line project. It helps you complete court forms
        other legal documents. Each form has been turned into an interview that
        that guides you through the process of completing the form. In some
        cases, we can deliver (e-file) your forms directly to the court.

        The online guided interviews on Court Forms Online have been built by
        lawyers, designers, developers, law students, and others. Some are
        maintained by the LIT Lab, while others are built and maintained by
        other organizations.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        We use a free and open source tool,{' '}
        <a href="https://docassemble.org/">Docassemble</a>, to ask step-by-step
        questions as part of an interview that guides you through completing the
        form. Then we use your answers to assemble complete, ready-to-file PDF
        documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use the Court Forms Online on a desktop computer or a
        smartphone.

        Some forms need to be printed and delivered by you. Some forms include
        button that delivers your form by email. And other works are integrated
        directly with the court’s{' '}
