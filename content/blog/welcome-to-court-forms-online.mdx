Over the last month, we've been working hard to add new, helpful content
to the Court Forms Online website. New features include:

* Syndication of Docassemble forms from our partner nonprofits in:
    * Maine, powered by [Pine Tree Legal Assistance](https://ptla.org)
    * Minnesota, from [Minnesota Law Help](https://www.lawhelpmn.org/) and [HomeLine Minnesota](https://www.homelinemn.org/)
    * Michigan, from [Michigan Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/)
    * Vermont, from [Vermont Law Help](https://vtlawhelp.org/)
* More helpful information on almost every page, helping make sure you fill your forms
  in without any mistakes.
* General guides on finding an attorney, how to use a guided interview, how to find your court, and how to pick the right form for your
  legal need.
* Clearer context, letting you more easily see when forms were last reviewed, what jurisdiction a form is for, and
  what topic a form is part of.
* Links to related resources, including similar forms and your state's nonprofit legal triage tool.
* This new blog, where we will share updates when new forms are added and information about how to select the right form for your need.

## What is Court Forms Online?

Court Forms Online makes it easier to complete legal documents through guided interviews. Instead of staring at a blank form and wondering what to write, our step-by-step interviews ask you simple questions and use your answers to fill in the forms automatically.

Most of our forms are also linked directly in your state's free legal information website. This site exists as
a central index and offers a different way to find a form when you already have an idea that a court form is the
right way to solve your legal need.

## Want to bring Court Forms Online to your state?

Students in the [LIT Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org) work on automating court forms and other legal documents each semester.
You can send us a note at litlab@suffolk.edu if you want to learn if we can collaborate on a new project! We'd especially
love to hear from the legal aid program in your state if we can build a sustainable, long-term partnership.
